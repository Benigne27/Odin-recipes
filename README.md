# Odin-recipes

This a website for recipes which I created while learning different web development features like how to set it up locally using Git and remotely using GitHub.

I also learned how to create html files, adding headings (h1, h2, etc.), links using 'a' tag, images using 'img' tag and paragraphs using the 'p' tag.

One more thing I learned is how to make ordered lists, which are numbered with actual numbers, and unordered lists, which are numbered with bullets. And to do all this we use 'ol' and 'li' tags for ordered lists and 'ul' and 'li' tags for unordered lists.
