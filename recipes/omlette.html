    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      An omelette or omelet is a dish you might order for breakfast or brunch.
      It's kind of like a folded pancake made of beaten eggs, sometimes with the
      addition of vegetables, cheese, or meat. Yum! A good omelette is a little
      bit fluffy, but firm enough to contain its fillings. Omelette is a French
      word which was first officially used in French cooking publication,
      Cuisine Bourgeoisie in the late 17th century.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>3 eggs, beaten</li>
      <li>1 tsp sunflower oil</li>
      <li>Salt</li>
      <li>Pepper</li>
      <li>1 tsp butter</li>
      <li>Sliced onions, tomatoes and other filling you like</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Season the beaten eggs well with salt and pepper. Heat the oil and
        butter in a non-stick frying pan over a medium-low heat until the butter
        has melted and is foaming.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour the eggs into the pan, tilt the pan ever so slightly from one side
        to another to allow the eggs to swirl and cover the surface of the pan
        completely. Let the mixture cook for about 20 seconds then scrape a line
        through the middle with a spatula.
      </li>
      <li>
        Tilt the pan again to allow it to fill back up with the runny eggs.
        Repeat once or twice more until the eggs has just set.
      </li>
      <li>
        At this point, you can fill the omelette with whatever you like - some
        grated cheese, fresh herbs, sliced onions or tomatoes all work well.
        Scatter the filling over the top of the omelette and fold gently in half
        with the spatula. Slide onto a plate to serve.
